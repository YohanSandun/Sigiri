# Sigiri
Sigiri is a simple, object-oriented, interpreted programming laguage.
<br>
Due to performance issues and platform compatibility issues, this project will also get developed using C++ in https://github.com/YohanSandun/CSigiri
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Both repositories (Sigiri and CSigiri) will continue to develop simultaneously. Those who are not familiar with C++ can follow on this repository.
