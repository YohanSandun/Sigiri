# Complex
As well as the real numbers, Sigiri can handle complex numbers. You can manipulate complex numbers using methods provided by `system.math` library.

### How to define a complex number?
There are two ways of doing that. You can define a complex number using number literals or using built-in `complex(x, y)` method. 
Complex numbers are denoted by x+yi where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part, i is just the symbol showing that, this is a complex number.
```sh
c = 1+2i			//spaces are not allowed between numbers when defining complex numbers.
c = complex(1, 2)	//same number using `complex(x, y)` method.
```
